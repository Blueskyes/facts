Python Language:


* In 1991, Guido Van Rossum made the Python language.
* There are many features in the python program such as the procedural styles, functional programming, and (OOP)objected oriented programming.
* Python provides several builtin functions like prtin() and input(), but you can also write your own functions.
* Python also comes with a set of modules called the standard library.
* Guido Van Rossum liked “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” and this iis where the name of the Python language came from.
