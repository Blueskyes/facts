When one @llama has an issue with another llama, it will stick its tongue out to express its displeasure
@Llamas can reach speeds up to 35mph
In the ancient Incan society, @llamas were the only beast of burden, and were a symbol of wealth among the Incan nobility
One of the ways @llamas communicate is by humming
